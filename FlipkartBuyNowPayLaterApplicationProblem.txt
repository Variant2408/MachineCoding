The task was to implement a Flipkart Buy Now Pay Later application. The key requirements were:


Users should be assigned an initial credit limit.
While placing an order, users can choose to either:
Pay in cash
Use the Pay Later feature
Users get 30 days to clear dues.
Users should be blacklisted if they default on payments 3 or more times.
The problem required careful handling of edge cases like consecutive defaults and state management for user blacklisting.
